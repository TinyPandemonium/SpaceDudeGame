# SpaceDudeGame Project Proposal

spin on the traditional game of spaceman using vanilla Javascript

## Current goals

- I want users to input a single letter and have it be labeled as a correct guess or an incorrect guess.

- I want letters to pop up that have already been guessed and make it such that the user can't input the same value again

- create a fun environment that is visually appealing to the user

- I want to let users know when they have lost the game or won the game and have the game reset

## Stretch goals

- have different categories to choose from so the user has some idea of what to guess about

- have letters show up as green for correct guesses and red if they are incorrect

## Languages being used

- HMTL

- CSS

-Javascript
